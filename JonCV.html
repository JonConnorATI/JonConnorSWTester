  <summary>Propylon, Dublin - QA Analyst - December 2022 to Present</summary>
  <article>
    <p>Propylon is a developer of legislative drafting software. I work with the QA analysts to identify key test cases for 
      regression. Using the Robot Framework tool I then automate the test cases and add them to the overnight runs. These 
      test cases are then removed from the manual backlog. I spend my time creating test cases and reporting defects identified 
      in the overnight automation runs. The test cases chosen for automation are a mixture of existing functionality and new 
      features. They are chosen based on discussion with the QA team based on the risk.</p>

  <summary>SAP, Dublin (Employed via Manpower Ireland) - Contract QA Engineer - August 2020 - June 2021</summary>
  <article><p>Working in the QA department of the localisation team. Reviewing strings for translatability by flagging and logging 
    localisation issues in JIRA. Using a Selenium/Java/Jenkins/Git framework to update, fix or create new scripts. The 
    automated scripts capture screen shots of the strings and aid translation by providing context to the strings. After 
    translation, ensuring the functionality of the translated screens is intact by running the scripts in the localised languages. 
    Using JIRA to investigate new features for new strings and deciding to either update existing scripts or create new ones. 
    Increased the overnight pass rates from 30% to 75% by using pre-created events in the scripts rather than creating the 
    event from scratch.
