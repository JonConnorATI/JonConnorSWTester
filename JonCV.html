  <summary>Propylon, Dublin - QA Analyst - December 2022 to Present</summary>
  <article>
    <p>Propylon is a developer of legislative drafting software. I work with the QA analysts to identify key test cases for 
      regression. Using the Robot Framework tool I then automate the test cases and add them to the overnight runs. These 
      test cases are then removed from the manual backlog. I spend my time creating test cases and reporting defects identified 
      in the overnight automation runs. The test cases chosen for automation are a mixture of existing functionality and new 
      features. They are chosen based on discussion with the QA team based on the risk.</p>

  <summary>SAP, Dublin - Contract QA Engineer - August 2020 - June 2021</summary>
  <article><p>Working in the QA department of the localisation team. Reviewing strings for translatability by flagging and logging 
    localisation issues in JIRA. Using a Selenium/Java/Jenkins/Git framework to update, fix or create new scripts. The 
    automated scripts capture screen shots of the strings and aid translation by providing context to the strings. After 
    translation, ensuring the functionality of the translated screens is intact by running the scripts in the localised languages. 
    Using JIRA to investigate new features for new strings and deciding to either update existing scripts or create new ones. 
    Increased the overnight pass rates from 30% to 75% by using pre-created events in the scripts rather than creating the 
    event from scratch.

  <summary>Interactive Services, Dublin - Software Tester - May 2017 – April 2018</summary>
  <article><p>Responsible for the testing within a development team that specializes in the localization of e-learning courses for the 
    financial services sectors. There was no formal test plan, so I developed and implemented a test charter, so all software 
    released was at an acceptable standard. Client fixes for functionality dropped dramatically. Upskilled in HTML/CSS and 
    GIT so that I could fix minor text and graphics issues. The Project Manager would receive minor issues from client and 
    assign to me to fix. I would then assign back to Project Manager to keep independence in the fix and verify bug cycle. This 
    freed up programmers to do more urgent and important tasks in the project.</p>

  <summary>Actavo (In Home Division), Dublin - Warehouse Tester - August 2016 – April 2017</summary>
  <article><p>Tested set top boxes (SKY TV) to confirm faulty using a series of manual tests. Updated the stock on the company’s system 
    and organised return to the client. By asking the business leaders and managers questions about the high level of set top 
    boxes that were incorrectly assigned as faulty. I could see the negative impact it had on the business. I created a simple 
    spreadsheet that recorded every set top box I tested along with Engineer ID, Team, Team Manager and Area Manager. I 
    was then able to identify which Engineers, Teams, Managers and Area Managers were having issues diagnosing faulty set 
    top boxes. Extra training was arranged, and the non-faulty boxes returned as faulty steadily dropped to an acceptable 
    level.</p>
