Experience

Contract QA Analyst, Propylon, Dublin
December 2022– Present
Propylon is a developer of legislative drafting software. I work with the QA analysts to identify key test cases for regression. Using the Robot Framework tool I then automate the test cases and add them to the overnight runs. These test cases are then removed from the manual backlog. I spend my time creating test cases and reporting defects identified in the overnight automation runs. The test cases chosen for automation are a mixture of existing functionality and new features. They are chosen based on discussion with the QA team based on the risk.

Contract QA Analyst, Pexlify, Dublin
June 2022 – December 2022
Pexlify is a certified partner of Salesforce and a recommended developer of Salesforce customisation for its clients. Currently working on a Salesforce Financial Services cloud implementation for Ruffer PLC. This is an agile project and I manually test stories during each sprint, report any bugs or issues in Jira and verify fixes have been implemented correctly. Identifying test cases and stories to use for regression testing as the sprints progress and building suites of automated tests in a Java/selenium framework.
Helped other QA Analysts learn Java & Selenium, bitbucket and Git by creating a standardise framework they could copy and expand on. Held weekly Q&A sessions to assist their learning. 

 
Contract QA Analyst, The Central Bank of Ireland, Dublin (Employed via Expleo Group)
June 2021 – June 2022
Working on the ‘Fitness and Probity’ agile project to bring a paper application process to a fully online front-end web-based application, integrated with a client (Bank) side CRM. 
Attend and participate in agile ceremonies - daily stand-up’s, fortnightly sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives, backlog grooming sessions, estimation sessions, three amigo’s sessions.
Prepare test cases, log static defects when conflicts are identified between acceptance criteria and requirements documentation. Carry out test execution and log defects, retest and close fixed issues. Assist with UAT and investigate UAT defects. 

Contract QA Engineer, SAP Ariba, Dublin (Employed via Manpower Ireland)
August 2020 – June 2021
Working in the QA department of the localisation team. Reviewing strings for translatability by flagging and logging localisation issues in JIRA. Using a Selenium/Java/Jenkins/Git framework to update, fix or create new scripts. The automated scripts capture screen shots of the strings and aid translation by providing context to the strings. After translation, ensuring the functionality of the translated screens is intact by running the scripts in the localised languages.
Using JIRA to investigate new features for new strings and deciding to either update existing scripts or create new ones.
Increased the overnight pass rates from 30% to 75% by using pre-created events in the scripts rather than creating the event from scratch.

Contract Software Tester, Accounting Technicians Ireland, Dublin 2
April 2018 – March 2020
Successfully implemented an assessment module in the new CRM software package by identifying missing requirements in the developer’s specifications from the test cases I wrote for coverage of the business rules. Working on a membership module to add to the CRM and enhancing an existing apprentice module to accommodate new business vision and requirements. Using cucumber and gherkin to develop and produce business requirements for these new modules.

Software Tester, Interactive Services, Dublin 15
May 2017 – April 2018
Responsible for the testing within a development team that specializes in the localization of e-learning courses for the financial services sectors. There was no formal test plan, so I developed and implemented a test charter, so all software released was at an acceptable standard. Client fixes for functionality dropped dramatically. Upskilled in HTML/CSS and GIT so that I could fix minor text and graphics issues. The Project Manager would receive minor issues from client and assign to me to fix. I would then assign back to Project Manager to keep independence in the fix and verify bug cycle. This freed up programmers to do more urgent and important tasks in the project.

Warehouse Tester, Actavo (In Home Division), Dublin 12
August 2016 – April 2017
Tested set top boxes (SKY TV) to confirm faulty using a series of manual tests. Updated the stock on the company’s system and organised return to the client. By asking the business leaders and managers questions about the high level of set top boxes that were incorrectly assigned as faulty. I could see the negative impact it had on the business. I created a simple spreadsheet that recorded every set top box I tested along with Engineer ID, Team, Team Manager and Area Manager. I was then able to identify which Engineers, Teams, Managers and Area Managers were having issues diagnosing faulty set top boxes. Extra training was arranged, and the non-faulty boxes returned as faulty steadily dropped to an acceptable level.

Pre-2016
Emissions testing roles and 12 years in a quality assurance and quality control role for a manufacturer of adhesive papers and vinyl.
