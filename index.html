  <div class="container-intro odd">
    <div class="container--a">
      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p class="ost--one">I am a software tester and believe the role of a tester is much more than finding bugs. My view is that the tester is an advocate for the end users and should be involved in the Development Lifecycle from the beginning.<br><br>
      For me being part of a team that provides software solutions to its clients and hearing the words, <b><i>"This is exactly what we were looking for"</i></b> is what its all about.<br><br> 
      This web page idea came to me when I read an article on linkedin where the author (apologies for not giving credit, can't find the post now) stated that Information Technology is not <em>WORKING</em> for a living but rather <em>LEARNING</em> for a living.<br><br>
      So that inspired me to write a web page. I took an online course in flexbox and added a few bits of javascript that I know. At the same time I decided to do an article about Cucumber and Bug reports. The reasoning being if you can't explain it you don't understand it.<br><br>
      I have found this project enjoyable and challenging. The most challenging part has been the content. Somebody once sent me an email, that started with, <q>Sorry this email is so long but I didn't have time to write a short one.</q> I completely get that now.

<!--Automation Frameworks-->
  <div class="container-intro even">
    <div class="container--a">
      <h1>Automation Framework Experience</h1>
      <p class="ost--one odd">Here is a brief summary of the Frameworks I have worked on.<span class="mobile" style="color:#27afea">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
      
        
            <ul class="list">   
            <li><p class="ost--one odd">A localisation project I worked on, we used Selenium/Java to navigate the UI and take screenshots of the pages to give context to translators. The pages were translated we would run the same tests again and SME's would carry out a Linguistic check on the translated pages, and I would check that the translation hadn't broken any functionality.</li></p>
            <li><p class="ost--one odd">I started using Cucumber when I was on a project that was going round in circles and found it most useful in agreeing on requirements with the business users and the developers. The devlopers didn't understand the business rules and the business didn't know how to give them the requirements. Nothing was getting implemented correctly because the developers had to wade through reams and reams of business literature and identify the key elements. Cucumber enabled me to write short scenarios covering all the rules, that the business could agree on and the devlopers understood.</li></p>
            <li><p class="ost--one odd">I've been working with Robot Framework for the last 6 months at a company that develops legislative drafting software. I can't recommend this tool highly enough. It can be used for Browser UI, API and Desktop Applications and lots more. Its based on Python and the syntax is very simple. The librarys imported contain keywords (functions) and you create your own keywords using plain english consisting of the pre built functions. Like cucumber the tests are readable by anybody with or without technical knowledge.</li></p>
          </ul>

        <br><br>

        <p class="ost--one odd">For anybody who's interested in learning more about Automation, or would like to play around with the frameworks, I have created three repositorys in GitHub that carry out the same tests on the same website. Please feel free to clone a copy and play around.<br><br>Click on an item below to see the repository on GitHub.</p>

      <h1>The 7 Principles of Software Testing</h1>
        <p class="ost--one">These 7 principles were the first things I ever learnt about Software Testing. I always refer to them when I am starting a new project, and when issues arise to check I am on the right path.<span class="mobile" style="color:	#FFFFFF">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>

      <div class="dropdown"><button class="dropbtn">Beware of the pesticide paradox</button>
        <div class="dropdown-content"><a>Repetitive use of the same pesticide mix to eradicate insects will lead to the insects developing pesticide resistance. The same applies to software testing. If the same tests are conducted, the method will be useless for discovering new defects.</a></div>

          <div class="dropdown-content"><a>It is possible that software 99% bug-free is still unusable. The system could have been tested for the wrong requirement. Software testing is not just finding defects, but checking that the software meets the business needs.</a></div>
