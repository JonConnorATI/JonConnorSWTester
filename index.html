      <h1 class=>About me</h1>
      <p class="ost--one">I am a software tester and believe the role of a tester is much more than finding bugs. My view is that the tester is an advocate for the end users and should be involved in the Development Lifecycle from the beginning.<br><br>
      For me being part of a team that provides software solutions to its clients and hearing the words, <b><i>"This is exactly what we were looking for"</i></b> is what its all about.<br><br> 
      This web page idea came to me when I read an article on linkedin where the author (apologies for not giving credit, can't find the post now) stated that Information Technology is not <em>WORKING</em> for a living but rather <em>LEARNING</em> for a living.<br><br>
      So that inspired me to write a web page. I took an online course in flexbox and added a few bits of javascript that I know. At the same time I decided to do an article about Cucumber and Gherkin after doing a course. The reasoning being if you can't explain it you don't understand it.<br><br>
      I have found this project enjoyable and challenging. The most challenging part has been the content. Somebody once sent me an email, that started with, <q>Sorry this email is so long but I didn't have time to write a short one.</q> I completely get that now.

        Result - software was delivered <i><b>faster</b></i> and <i><b>better.</b></i><br><br>

      <h1>The 7 Principles of Software Testing</h1>
        <p class="ost--one">These 7 principles were the first things I ever learnt about Software Testing. I always refer to them when I am starting a new project, and when issues arise to check I am on the right path.<br>
        <br>Below are the principles,<em> hover on each one, </em>I have included a brief description of what they mean to me.

      <div class="contents-seven">
        <div class="dropdown"><button class="dropbtn">Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence</button>
        <div class="dropdown-content"><a>Testing reduces the probability of undiscovered defects but even if no defects are found, it is not proof of correctness</a></div>
      </div>
      <div class="dropdown"><button class="dropbtn">Beware of the pesticide paradox</button>
        <div class="dropdown-content"><a>Repetitive use of the same pesticide mix to eradicate insects will lead to the insects developing pesticide resistance. The same applies to software testing. If the same tests are conducted, the method will be useless for discovering new defects.</a></div>
      </div>
         
        <div class="dropdown"><button class="dropbtn">Defects cluster together</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content"><a> The Pareto Principle to software testing: approximately 80% of the problems are found in 20% of the modules</a></div>
        </div>
       
        <div class="dropdown"><button class="dropbtn">Testing is context dependent</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content"><a>The way you test an e-commerce site will be different from the way you test a flight simmulator. You might use a different approach, methodologies, techniques, and types of testing depending upon the application type.</a></div>
        </div>
        <div class="dropdown"><button class="dropbtn">Absence-of-errors is a fallacy</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content"><a>It is possible that software 99% bug-free is still unusable. The system could have been tested for the wrong requirement. Software testing is not just finding defects, but checking that the software meets the business needs.</a></div>
        </div>
        <div class="dropdown"><button class="dropbtn">Exhaustive testing is impossible</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content"><a>We can't test everything, there are too many inputs and outputs. Concentrate on the biggest risks.</a></div>
        </div>
        <div class="dropdown"><button class="dropbtn">Early testing saves time and money</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content"><a>Testing should start as early as possible in development, so defects are captured in the early stages. It is much cheaper to fix a defect early in the development.</a></div>
