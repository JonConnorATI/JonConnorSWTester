      <h1>Conversations</h1>
      <p id="ost--one">The main feature of Behaviour Driven Development are the converstions between the development team and the business. The business telling the developers they want X and then receiving something in 4 weeks is not BDD.</p>
      <p id="ost--one">It really is all about the conversations, you can have cucumber, scrum meetings, Jira, Kanban boards but if you are not having the conversations about the software with developers, business users and testers then BDD will not work. The converstations are the key.</p>
      <p id="ost--one">The conversations are the key but equally important is who is having the converstions. If its just the technical team (Developers and Testers) that's not BDD. The business users have to be included because the business users will be driving the development.If the Businness wonâ€™t interact with the technical team becuase they are too busy then BDD is not how they should proceed with their project. They should probably look at buying something off the shelf.</p>
      <p id="ost--one">BDD is about including the business in the development by using simple plain english to describe the behaviour of the software. Its a simple idea but is very powerful. When we decide we need software, we describe it a very high level. For example "I want a sofware package that handles all my online transactions." So how do we get from having nothing to that high level of completion?</p>
